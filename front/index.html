          <p>
            This portal is designed to guide you through the full lifecycle of working
            with AI models. Even if you are not an expert in machine learning, you
            will find clear steps to:

          <ul>
            <li>Prepare your data and train new AI models.</li>
            <li>Inspect and analyzealready trained AI models</li>
            <li>Browse and use models that are already trained.</li>
            <li>Understand what happens during training at a high level.</li>

            <h2>Train a New Model</h2>
            <p>
              In this part of the portal you will be able to start training your own
              AI models. We will guide you step by step: from choosing a task and
              uploading data, to monitoring the training progress and saving your model.

              You don’t need deep technical knowledge; the interface will explain what
              you are doing in simple terms.

            <h3>What training means</h3>
            <p>
              Training a model means showing it many examples so it can learn patterns
              and make predictions on new, unseen data. The dedicated page will give
              you a short, friendly explanation before you start.

            <h2>Inspect Existing Model</h2>
            <p>
              This section allows you to inspect and analyze models that have already been
              trained. You can view model architecture, check training metrics, examine
              model performance, and understand how the model makes predictions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspecting models helps you understand their behavior, verify their quality,
              and make informed decisions about which models to use for your tasks.

            <h3>What inspection provides</h3>
            <p>
              The inspection page will show you detailed information about trained models,
              including their structure, training history, performance metrics, and how to
              interpret their outputs. This helps you understand and trust the models you use.

            <h2>Use Already Trained Models</h2>
            <p>
              If you don't want to train a new model from scratch, you can simply use
              models that are already trained. This is usually faster and easier, and
              is a great way to get quick results.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will be able to pick a model, provide your input, and get predictions
              or answers back from the system.

            <h3>Why reuse models?</h3>
            <p>
              Reusing trained models saves time and computing resources. The dedicated
              page will help you choose which model fits your needs and how to use it
              safely.

              Here you will later find clear, step‑by‑step documentation that explains
              how to use this portal, what each option means, and how to avoid common
              mistakes when working with AI models.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is to give you a simple reference you can always come back to:
              from basic concepts, to how to train, to how to use existing models.
